# Build Images
The 76 EDDGE build images are created using the dockerfiles in this repository. They are used to build separate components of different projects.

## Building
The components necessary to build each image are stored in a top-level directory matching the tag for the image. All building and uploading is handled via the CI workflow scripts.
